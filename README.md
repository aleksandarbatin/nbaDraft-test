# NBA draft - test

Task was to make a table and display data of latest NBA draft. I used vue.js.

## Getting Started

To try how it works you need to have NODE.js and of course GIT installed on your machine and simply do 

```
git clone https://github.com/aleksandarbatin/nbaDraft-test.git
cd nbaDraft-test
npm install
```
For project developing I used vue-cli, all files to work on it are in /src folder  

## Running the project

As a part of VUE workflow I used some basic: 

#vue-router - for routing.

#axios - for making HTTP request

To run and test project in google chrome you need chrome extension -Allow-Control-Allow-Origin: *-  a mechanism that allows JavaScript on a web page to make XMLHttpRequests to another domain and command 

```
npm run dev
```
Enjoy it!
